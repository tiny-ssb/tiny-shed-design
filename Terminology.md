# Terminology.md

A set of terms around "conference" that we use in the TinySched
project, and what they stand for.


## Program

A Program is a hierarchy
```
conf
  day
    block
      session
        talk
```


## Conference

= online version of a physical event. Applies to physical events
running multiple days but can also apply to a half-day unconference.


## (Conference) Owner

= the person in charge of the online presence of the physical event,
makes ultimate decision regarding roles (admin). This can also be
the spokesperson of a board.

Having only one owner makes the implementation easier (no conflict
resolution needed).

The owner can delegate some of the decision making.


## Participant

= person having paid the conference fee


## Speaker / Presenter

...


## Admin / Currator

...


## Admin / Steward

...


## Location

## "Talk" / Activity

recreation time, unconference)


## Session

## Block
