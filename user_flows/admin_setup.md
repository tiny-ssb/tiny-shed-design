# User Flows - Admin Setup

This flow covers everything an "Admin" of the conference needs to get them
and their team set up to use the application


WIP - this is a stub that needs more details

Things to consider:
- defining the "event"
- defining other "admin" accounts
- sharing a link for event contributions

Other flows?
- reviewing / approving sessions
- scheduling sessions with space/time
- reviewing / approving attendees
