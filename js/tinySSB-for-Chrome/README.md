# tinySSB Development: virtual backend for the Chrome Browser

Rationale: instead of writing JS and HTML code for your tinySSB
mini-app and then compiling it for Android for trying it out, this
"tinySSB-for-Chrome" environment enables you to test your mini-app
directly inside a Chrome brower tab.

Using Chrome's broadcast feature between tabs, new log entries are
sent to all tabs where they are funneled to your JS app logic. See the
attached PDF for details.
